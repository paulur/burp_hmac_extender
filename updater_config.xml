<!--
	This configuration file specifies the required four attributes to invoke a specific hmac updater class:

	1. service-base-url
	The base URL  distinguishes a service/app. For example, if the url of an API  is demo.qa.com:8080/getUser/ID, the service-base-url is demo.qa.com:8080.

	If the same domain and port number support multiple services/apps, for example,
	the service appA is on demo.qa.com:8080/demo/appA, and the service appB is on demo.qa.com:8080/demo/appB,
	the base URLfor appA is demo.qa.com:8080/demo/appA, and the base URL for LAS is demo.qa.com:8080/demo/appA.

	Note: 
		i. protocol (i.e., http or https), domain name, and port number are all required. 
		ii .the port number can be found in Burp's reqeusts.

	2. updater-class
	The updater class specifies the full path of class that implements the logic of updating the hmac header.

	3. client-id
	Client ID specifies the ID of the service that sends in the hmac signature

	4. signature-place-holder
	Signature placeholder specifies the exact location of the hmac signaure and use $ at the location of hmac signature

	For example, if the hmac signature is in the Authorization header as the following:
	Authorization: hmac-v1 LzlZ+3cpOJdO8TYD4Q29BAEHdCQ=	
	The place holder is thus  Authorization: hmac-v1 $

	For another example,  if the hmac signature is in the Authorization header as the following:
	Authorization: hmac-v1 ClientID:EhE4QMRlQg1pnE0pbiWdlV6Zz4Q%3D	something
	The placeholder is	Authorization:hmac-v1 ClientID:$	something

	Note:
	The placeholder is a shortcut for implementing the update function. An Updater class can use other ways to update the hmac signature.
	In case the placeholder is not used by an updater class, add a dummy value in this configuration attribute.

	In case the placeholder is used, we recommend the $ sign replace exactly the original hmac value, if there is any space/tab in front or after the value, the space/tab should NOT be included in the place holder. For example, if the original header is "Authorization: hmac-v1	EhE4QMRlQg1pnE0pbiWdlV6Zz4Q%3D	something", where EhE4QMRlQg1pnE0pbiWdlV6Zz4Q%3D is the original hmac signature, and there a tab between "hmac-v1" and this signature and a space between this signature and "something", the value of the placeholder attribute is "Authorization: hmac-v1	$ something" where the tab and the space characters are kept.
